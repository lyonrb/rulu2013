We have a late change to the speakers list. Unfortunately Carina Zona will not join us.

          Greg is an infrastructure developer and a cofounder at Green Alto where he writes code that builds servers. After managing Linux servers in his bedroom in high school for fun, he learned HTML, CSS and PHP by himself. He never thought of making a career of it until it actually happened. He became a professional frontend developer back when you didn't have to know JavaScript, learned OOP, TDD and MVC all at one with Python, switched to Ruby & Rails around the release of Rails 2.0.

<p>His talk: <b><i>Dependencies, a boring, solved problem?</i></b></p>
<p>As Ruby developers, we all love RubyGems and Bundler. These tools are pretty amazing when it comes to installing the dependencies of your web app. Do they solve everything for command-line applications too?<br />

In theory, you install the right version of Ruby and then run gem install. In practice, it's a bit more complicated than that.<br />

I will show you examples of the different ways things can and will break, based on real issues I encountered as a developer and sysadmin. That includes dependencies that "work today!" (but probably won't tomorrow) and the mess created by the API instability in gems like json. We will also look at how other programming languages deal with library and their dependencies. Finally, I will tell you why vendoring everything in a system package is a good approach.</p>
