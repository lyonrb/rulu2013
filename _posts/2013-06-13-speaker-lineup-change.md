There are some late changes to the speaker list. It is with regret that we inform you that Carina Zona will not be speaking at RuLu 2013. 

We worked with Carina to help find a sponsor to cover her costs for attending RuLu but, disappointingly, were unable to do so. 

We will be announcing a new speaker to join the lineup for RuLu 2013 in the coming days - please check back soon.
