All Rulu attendees and speakers are invited to a Dinner & Party at Le Koodeta, a Gourmet Restaurant & Pub located 15 minutes walk from the venue. Le Koodeta features a large patio with olive trees, an outdoor bar and confy sofas.
We'll go there right after the last sessions, to enjoy sunshine on the terrace and local food & wine treats.
