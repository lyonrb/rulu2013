Attendees may come to Lyon on the day before the conference. So we thought there was no point waiting for Thursday to get the party started!

That's why we booked a few tables at the [Brasserie F&G](http://www.fandg-restaurant.com/), [10 rue de la RÃ©publique, 69001 Lyon](http://goo.gl/maps/geADY). You should meet there on Wednesday at 7:30pm and enjoy some French wine and food.
