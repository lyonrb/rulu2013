So we thought we'd put together some suggestions for things to do in Lyon after the Friday workshops.

Friday is <a href="http://www.fetedelamusique.culture.fr/en/International/presentation/" target="_blank">Fête de la Musique</a> (World Music Day) and Lyon puts on a huge party! As the evening wears on, the streets, squares and parks of Lyon fill up with musicians putting on concerts - 
<a href="http://www.culture.lyon.fr/culture/sections/fr/festivals/musiques_actuelles/fete_de_la_musique/fete_de_la_musique" target="_blank"> details here (in French)</a>. 
So, whatever you choose to do following the workshops, do make Fête de la Musique part of your plans!

The main information center in Lyon is in Place Bellecour. They also have a <a href="http://www.en.lyon-france.com/">website</a> that is worth checking out.
Place Bellecour is well worth a visit - it is one of the central squares in Lyon and is likely to feature heavily in the festivities of Fête de la Musique.

<h4>Visit Old Lyon and the Basilica of Fourvière</h4>

Old Lyon (Vieux Lyon) is a great part of Lyon for a meandering walk and is a favourite amongst tourists and locals alike. It features Cathedral St Jean and several public squares lined with restaurants,
bars, creperies and pubs.

If you are not averse to a climb, you can walk up to the Basilica of Fourvière and visit the ruins of the Gallo Roman amphitheatre. There is a <a href="http://www.en.lyon-france.com/Guided-Tours-Excursions/Unmissable/From-Fourviere-to-The-Old-Lyon">guided tour</a>
or you can make your own up by arming yourself with a map and getting to Vieux Lyon metro (on the D line) and exploring the narrow streets of the quartier. There are a lot of 
Bouchons (restaurants typical of the Lyon area) in this area but be warned that several of them are overpriced tourist traps. Recommend stopping off at <a href="http://www.glaciernardone.com/en/strolling-around-the-city.html">Nardone</a> for an ice-cream or a crepe as you take in the sights.
The view of Lyon from Fourvière is quite something and the walk through the gardens to the Basilica is very pleasant, so, if it's good weather, this is a good way to build up an appetite!

<h4>Explore Croix-Rousse</h4>

[Croix-Rousse]("http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Croix-Rousse") is bohemian Lyon at it's best! This quartier features some of Lyon's best independent art, craft, food and drink. Want a souvenier to take home?
You'll find something original here for sure!

Start at the Hotel de Ville metro stop (on the A line), check out the sights around the Opera and Place des Terreaux, and then head uphill. You can find 
awesome, locally designed t-shirts at [Laspid](http://laspid.com) in Place du Griffon, some of Lyon's best coffee at [Cafe Mokxa](http://www.cafemokxa.com) (3, Rue de l'Abbé Rozier) 
and lots of studios and boutiques as you wander up the Montée de la Grande Côte to the center of Croix-Rousse. At the top you get majestic views over the presquile. 

If you feel like a beer after your climb, suggest checking out [Dikkenek Cafe](http://www.yelp.fr/biz/dikkenek-caf%C3%A9-lyon-2#hrid:XfMsS80MkepGBaD-QyKsLw) at 3 rue d'Austerlitz, close to the 
center of Croix-Rousse.

<h4>Check out the Parc de la Tete d'Or</h4>

Feel like escaping the urban village? Head to 117 hectares of beautiful parkland in the north of Lyon. The [Parc de la Tete d'Or](http://www.loisirs-parcdelatetedor.com/anglais/anglais.htm) is a 
great place to go for a stroll or a run. It has a lake, a zoo, and is right next to Lyon's museum of modern art, the [Musée d'art contemporain de Lyon](http://www.mac-lyon.com/mac/sections/en/).
You can get to the Parc by walking there from the Massena metro stop (line A) or taking a bus to the Museum (the C5 from Place Bellecour).

Whatever you choose to do, we hope you have a nice adventure in Lyon! Please equip yourself with a map and have a safe and awesome time!
