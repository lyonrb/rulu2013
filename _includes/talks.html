        What's the worst that could happen if your app has a dependency on a malicious gem? How easy would it be to write a gem that could compromise a box?
      </p>
      <p>
        Much of the Ruby community blindly trusts our gems. This talk will make you second guess that trust. It will also show you how to vet gems that you do choose to use.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are four malicious gems I will be presenting:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Harvesting passwords from requests going through a Rails app
        </li>
        <li>
          Exposing the contents of a Rails app's database
        </li>
        <li>
          Compromising the source code of a Rails app
        </li>
        <li>
          Providing SSH access to a box a 'gem install' time and stealing gem cutter credentials (and going viral)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        My talk will increase awareness that these sort of gems can exist in the wild, show how easy it is for anyone to build malicious gems, and give easy techniques for identifying these gems.

When not writing code, he follows his other passions into the outdoors to rock climb, back country snowboard, kayak and surf.

        There are thousands of local Ruby groups worldwide. Sadly, many suffer along, become stagnant, some even die off. How can you make your local Ruby Group better and in so doing, improve the global Ruby Community? This talk focuses on the human side of getting a group together and making it successful so the members, as a group can contribute to the larger community. It is a universally useful guide to improving all parts of the ruby community, starting on a local level.

      A Ruby on Rails developer for the last 4 years, I currently work at Engine Yard as the US-East Team Lead and Community Lead for their world-class Application Support team. Additionally, I organize the Western New York Ruby Brigade. Traveling to conferences and Ruby meet ups around the US and Canada, I like to spread the word on the importance of community and coding, stressing the importance of outreach and focusing on the human side of being a coder.

        It took us four years to grow from an ambitious idea to a
        profitable business, with a small team and not a lot of resources.
        I'll tell you how making "just enough" and "good enough",
        with a fine mix of various best practices,
        a lot motivation and some Ruby, we've
        managed to build a fast-growing product and a happy company.

        We are often told that looking at a programming problem from more than one angle can be the key to finding a solution...but what about programming languages themselves? Does having multiple implementations of Ruby just mean that we can run Ruby code in more places? Or can alternate implementations improve the Ruby language itself? In this talk, I will tell the story of how a bug in JRuby led me to an area of poorly specified behavior in MRI, and how both implementations, and the Ruby language itself, came out better in the end.

        We are no factory: we are delicate organic systems that can work nicely if they are respected and used properly.
        We do not crash because we don't do enough, we crash because we do too much. We continually push ourselves to work, deliver and build : we expect and are expected to produce a lot. We forget we are not factories producing tons of product every day.
        We are machines, biological ones, tailored by millennia of genetic history. Ignoring this, leads to crashes.

        What is a proper schedule for our brain to learn and process information? Why can't we stay focused for 8 hours? What is the impact of sleep and naps? What is the impact of physical activity in our daily lives?
        In this talk we will see how much modern workplaces and schedules are disconnected from our biology, how we can change little things to avoid big crashes, work better and be happier.

        Think of the satisfaction you felt the first time you wrote a chain of Ruby method calls, as a C# developer, this was a scary moment. In this talk Michael will describe unlearning the C# way as he learned the Ruby way. How the languages compare, how the toolbox differ, and the pure joy of the brevity built into Ruby.

        Do you know what XSS stands for? If not, you'll find out, and you'll learn how to make these vulnerabilities a thing of the past. We'll need to talk about languages first though, and the steps involved in concisely representing meaning.

        Language is both about expressing and understanding, and in either case there's a lot of machinery involved that we tend to take for granted. By prying these processes apart we might gain some insights to smarten up our code. Does your app generate output as if it learned HTML from a phrase book?
