      Benjamin is a developer at Pivotal Labs. He has a strong passion for TDD, pairing, Agile and using technologies that get out of the programmer’s way (or the programmer out of the way). When not writing code, he follows his other passions into the outdoors to rock climb, back country snowboard, kayak and surf.

      A Ruby on Rails developer for the last 4 years, I currently work at Engine Yard as the US-East Team Lead and Community Lead for their world-class Application Support team. Additionally, I organize the Western New York Ruby Brigade. Traveling to conferences and Ruby meet ups around the US and Canada, I like to spread the word on the importance of community and coding, stressing the importance of outreach and focusing on the human side of being a coder.
